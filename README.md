# Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining - Homework 3

 This is a Github repository created to submit the third Homework of the **Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (ADM)** course for the MSc. in Data Science at the Sapienza University of Rome.


## What's inside this repository?

1. `README.md`: A markdown file that explains the content of the repository.

2. `main.ipynb`: A [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/robertomagno1/ADM-HM3/blob/main/main.ipynb) file containing all the relevant exercises and reports belonging to the homework questions, the *Command Line Question*, and the *Algorithmic Question*.

 ## Datasets

 The data used to work in this repository was obtained by performing web-scraping in the [Michelin Guide web page ](https://guide.michelin.com/en/it/restaurants) website via the `WebScraper` class contained in the web_scraper funcion . If you want to reproduce the data perform the following steps:



## Plots

 Since Plotly Express maps are not compiled well through NBViewer or Github, we recommend downloading the Notebook for a better visualization. If this isn't within your scope, we added a screenshot of the plot included in `main.ipynb`:

 However, this plot is made to be interactive so it is still recommended to visualize it in your own computer.
